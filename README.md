# Generic Repository for SpringData
### Background - what is generic SpringData Reposistory
SpringData simplifies the data access by geneate the data access object(DAO) so no more DAO implementation. Here is the Spring doc about it [spring persistence](https://www.baeldung.com/the-persistence-layer-with-spring-data-jpa). 

*Spring Data takes this simplification one step forward and makes it possible to remove the DAO implementations entirely. The interface of the DAO is now **the only artifact that we need to explicitly define**.*

*In order to start leveraging the Spring Data programming model with JPA, a DAO interface needs to extend the JPA specific Repository interface â€“ JpaRepository. This will enable Spring Data to find this interface and automatically create an implementation for it.*

*By extending the interface we get the most relevant CRUD methods for standard data access available in a standard DAO.*

**In SpringData, we need define an interface as a DAO for each entity. If there are hundreds of entities, it needs to have the the same number of interfaces to be defined in java files. This project provide a generic repository then it is not required to define the interface any more.**
